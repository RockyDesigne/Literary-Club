                <h2>Annabel Lee</h2>
                <h3>By <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe' target="_blank"> Edgar Allan Poe</a></h3>
                <p>
                    It was many and many a year ago, <br>
                    In a kingdom by the sea, <br>
                 That a maiden there lived whom you may know <br>
                    By the name of Annabel Lee; <br>
                 And this maiden she lived with no other thought <br>
                    Than to love and be loved by me. <br> <br>
                  
                 I was a child and she was a child, <br>
                    In this kingdom by the sea,  <br>
                 But we loved with a love that was more than love— <br>
                    I and my Annabel Lee— <br>
                 With a love that the wingèd seraphs of Heaven <br>
                    Coveted her and me. <br> <br>
                 
                 And this was the reason that, long ago, <br>
                    In this kingdom by the sea, <br>
                 A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling <br>
                    My beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
                 So that her highborn kinsmen came <br>
                    And bore her away from me, <br>
                 To shut her up in a sepulchre <br>
                    In this kingdom by the sea. <br> <br>
                 
                 The angels, not half so happy in Heaven, <br>
                    Went envying her and me— <br>
                 Yes!—that was the reason (as all men know, <br> 
                    In this kingdom by the sea) <br>
                 That the wind came out of the cloud by night, <br>
                    Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. <br> <br>
                 
                 But our love it was stronger by far than the love <br>
                    Of those who were older than we— <br>
                    Of many far wiser than we— <br>
                 And neither the angels in Heaven above <br>
                    Nor the demons down under the sea <br>
                 Can ever dissever my soul from the soul <br>
                    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br> <br>
                 
                 For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams <br>
                    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
                 And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes <br>
                    Of the beautiful Annabel Lee; <br>
                 And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side <br>
                    Of my darling—my darling—my life and my bride, <br>
                    In her sepulchre there by the sea— <br>
                    In her tomb by the sounding sea.

                <h2>If—</h2>
                <h3>By <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudyard_Kipling" target="_blank"> Rudyard Kipling</a></h3>
                <p>
                    If you can keep your head when all about you   <br>
    Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,    <br>
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br>
    But make allowance for their doubting too;    <br>
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br>
    Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies, <br>
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating, <br>
    And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise: <br> <br>

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;    <br>
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;    <br>
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster <br>
    And treat those two impostors just the same;   <br>
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken <br>
    Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools, <br>
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, <br>
    And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools: <br> <br>

If you can make one heap of all your winnings <br>
    And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss, <br>
And lose, and start again at your beginnings <br>
    And never breathe a word about your loss; <br>
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew <br>
    To serve your turn long after they are gone,    <br>
And so hold on when there is nothing in you <br>
    Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’ <br> <br>

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,    <br>
    Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch, <br>
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, <br>
    If all men count with you, but none too much; <br>
If you can fill the unforgiving minute <br>
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,    <br>
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,    <br>
    And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
